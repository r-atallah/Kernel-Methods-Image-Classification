# Kernel Methods for Machine Learning: Kaggle Challenge

This project was completed as part of the Kernel Methods for Machine Learning course in the MVA master, during the academic year 2023-2024, to validate the Kaggle challenge.

## Overview

In this project, we implemented various kernel methods and feature extraction techniques from scratch. Specifically, we implemented the following:

- **Kernel Ridge Classifier (KRC):** A classifier based on kernel ridge regression, implemented from scratch.
- **Kernel SVM with SMO Optimization:** A support vector machine (SVM) classifier with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) optimization, implemented from scratch.
- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
  - Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
  - Kernel Descriptors
  - Fisher Vector
